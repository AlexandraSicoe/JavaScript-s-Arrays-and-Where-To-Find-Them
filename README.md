# Task Overview:

Welcome to a fantastic adventure with JavaScript, the language of the web! This quest is not for the faint-hearted but for brave coders eager to plunge into the mysterious world of arrays, objects, JSON and more!

Your task, should you choose to accept it, involves a magical JSON file containing an array of objects. This JSON is the secret map, leading you to the sacred place known as the "index.js" file.

Every hero needs a sidekick, and yours is the "utilities.js" file. This helper will aid you in your journey with a multitude of functions. Your mission is to implement these functions and solve the tasks at hand.

## Part 1: Preparation

Create a JSON file named `data.json` with an array of objects. Each object represents a mystical creature with the following properties:

`name`: The name of the creature (string)
`type` The type of creature (string)
`age`: The age of the creature in magical years (number)
`powerLevel`: The power level of the creature (number from 1 to 10)
Create an index.js file. This is your quest map where you will use your utility functions to solve tasks.

Create a utilities.js file. This is your sidekick, containing all the functions needed for your quest.

## Part 2: Tasks

All these tasks need to be done by calling functions from the `utilities.js` file in your `index.js` file.

**Who's the eldest?**: Find out which creature is the oldest in the mystical realm. Display its name and age.

**Summing powers**: Calculate the sum of all creature power levels. How much power resides in the mystical realm?

**Average magic**: Find out the average age of all creatures. How old is the average creature in the magical realm?

**Type tally**: Count how many creatures are of each type. What is the most common creature type in the realm?

**Find by power**: Find all creatures whose power level is above 5. Which creatures hold such formidable power?

**Sorting the squad**: Sort all creatures by age, youngest to oldest.

**Name search**: Find a creature by its name. Can you find "Fluffy" in the mystical realm?

**Random selection**: Randomly select a creature from the array. Who will be your lucky companion today?

**Top power**: Find the creature with the highest power level. Who is the most powerful creature in the realm?

**Power ratio**: Calculate the ratio of power level to age for each creature. Who holds the most power per year?

Note:
The hero's path is filled with trials and tribulations. Don't forget, the power of JavaScript is with you - map, filter, reduce, and sort are your faithful companions in this journey. Good luck and happy coding!
